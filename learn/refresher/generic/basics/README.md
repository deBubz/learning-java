# Once again Java

So far going through the basics

creating a class with [Car.java](Hello/bin/Car.class)

## String 

- immutable list of characters
- scanner for input

String stuff with [String](StringWork/src/app/App.java)

## Array

You know how to do this

- arrays are a reference type, use toString() to print

## Arg v Params

- params  define what data type can be passed into a methods
- args are the data that is passed into the method
- when a method is called, the params get the value of the args passed to the function

### Call by value/ reference

- **Value** pass the value in the arg to the function
- **Reference** pass the reference of the object into the function

> Java **only** have call by value
